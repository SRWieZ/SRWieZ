PHP & Laravel developer! Indie dev. I enjoy working on open-source projects and building my products in public.

🚀 Currently working on [unolia.com](https://unolia.com/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=readme-srwiez). The best place to manage your domain names (DNS) is from the dashboard, the command line, or the API. It comes with a ton of features to help you have a secure and well-configured domain.
